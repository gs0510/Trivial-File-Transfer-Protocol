# Trivial-File-Transfer-Protocol
The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a protocol layered on the User Datagram transport Protocol (UDP) used over the Internet Protocol.  It also displays information as the transfer takes place, showing you the packet sizes being sent, the ACK receiving, etc. The number of retries of a data packet is set to be 3 in the code. It can be changed by the user.
